I am a computational social scientist passionate about leveraging technology to explore and enhance learning environments and information systems. My research is very interdisciplinary, but my main interests are in computational communication and sociology of education, science, and technology. In terms of methodology, I focus on quantitative methods, such as statistics, natural language processing (NLP), and network analysis. I then apply those techniques to investigate how science and technology shape communication and learning outcomes, particularly for marginalized communities. My goal is to contribute to more informed, equitable, and innovative societies through transformative technologies, policies, and strategies.

I'm currently finishing my undergraduate studies at the University of Richmond, where I major in Cognitive Science and minor in Data Science & Statics and Linguistics. Previously, I have conducted research at USC, CMU, and FBK, as well as an industry internship at Amazon Alexa AI.
